          This Galaxy space is the result of hard, collaborative work by many contributors.

          It is maintained by the [Galaxy Single-cell & sPatial Omics **SPOC** Community of Practice](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/singlecell/).

          This group unites scientists like yourself with software developers and bioinformaticians to create, share, and test resources to make single-cell & spatial omics analysis easier.
