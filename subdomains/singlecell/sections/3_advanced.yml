      Workflows are chains of of tools that can be run together at the click of a button. The following tabs contain both peer reviewed and community submitted workflows.
      Common workflow tags for our community are:
                    - <code>single-cell</code>
                    - <code>training</code> (for workflows that correspond to the Galaxy Training Network's tutorials)
                    - <code>data interoperability</code>
                    - <code>deconvolution</code>
                    - <code>spatial omics</code>
