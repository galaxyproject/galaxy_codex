          <p>
          If we label workflows well, it's easy for us to find useful workflows! Key labels we use are:
             - training (for workflows that correspond to the Galaxy Training Network's tutorials)
             - data interoperability
             - deconvolution
                                [Tag your workflows](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/workflows_annotate.html) with **#single-cell** and share publicly with other users!

                                You can see shared workflows below, which are chains of tools that can be run together at the click of a button.

          WorkflowHub and IWC are labels given to peer-reviewed workflows. PLACEHOLDER need search to include both.
