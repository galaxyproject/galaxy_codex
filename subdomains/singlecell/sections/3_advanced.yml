        description_html: >
          If we label workflows well, it's easy for us to find useful workflows! Key labels we use are:
             - training (for workflows that correspond to the Galaxy Training Network's tutorials)
             - data interoperability
             - deconvolution
          <p class="alert alert-success">
            [Tag your workflows](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/workflows_annotate.html) with **#single-cell** and share publicly with other users!
