        description_md: >
          If we label workflows well, it's easy for us to find useful workflows! Key labels we use are:

            - <code>training</code> (for workflows that correspond to the Galaxy Training Network's tutorials)
            - <code>data interoperability</code>
            - <code>deconvolution</code>

          <p class="alert alert-success">
            <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/workflows_annotate.html">Tag your workflows</a>
            with <b>#single-cell</b> and share publicly with other users!
          </p>

          You can see shared workflows below, which are chains of tools that can be run together at the click of a button.
