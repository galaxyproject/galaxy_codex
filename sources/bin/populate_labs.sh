# This script is meant to create or update communities labs and is launched weekly (Every Sunday at 8:00 am)
# To add you community, modify `.github/workflows/fetch_filter_resources.yaml` (instructions available in the yaml document)

# This script will create the structure and files needed for the generation of a community lab
# The files are created from generic templates, so you will need to review them and tailor them to your community.
# TODO : The week following the creation of the files in your community folder, review and edit the files to tailor them to your community needs.

## Structure : Creation of the 'Sections' folder
mkdir -p communities/$COMMUNITY/lab/sections/

# Files updated weekly (tools, workflows and tutorial)
## TOOLS

### Copy tools file from the template file if it does not yet exist
if [[ ! -e $tools_section ]]; then
    cp communities/all/labs/sections_templates/2_tools.yml $tools_section
fi

### Update the tool file
python sources/bin/extract_galaxy_tools.py \
    popLabSection \
    --curated communities/$COMMUNITY/resources/curated_tools.tsv \
    --lab $tools_section

### Creates a tools folder (in the communauty lab folder) with one yaml files per tool
python sources/bin/extract_galaxy_tools.py \
    getLabTools \
    --curated communities/$COMMUNITY/resources/curated_tools.tsv \

### Script to include the expected workflows
