Galaxy Codex
============

Galaxy Communities Dock (Galaxy CoDex) stores resources for Galaxy community contributors - people who are actively developing for Galaxy, from testing & fixing tutorials to administrator servers.

Currently, we have two main resources:

1. **Galaxy Community Catalog**: from tools, training & workflows.  The catalog is automatically updated every week.
2. **Galaxy Labs**: (led by Galaxy Australia!) main and tool panel content for communities to spin up UI-tested & informed subdomain pages


# Join the CoDex
