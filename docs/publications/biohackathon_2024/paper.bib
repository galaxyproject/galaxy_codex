    abstract = "{Galaxy is a mature, browser accessible workbench for scientific computing. It enables scientists to share, analyze and visualize their own data, with minimal technical impediments. A thriving global community continues to use, maintain and contribute to the project, with support from multiple national infrastructure providers that enable freely accessible analysis and training services. The Galaxy Training Network supports free, self-directed, virtual training with \\&gt;230 integrated tutorials. Project engagement metrics have continued to grow over the last 2 years, including source code contributions, publications, software packages wrapped as tools, registered users and their daily analysis jobs, and new independent specialized servers. Key Galaxy technical developments include an improved user interface for launching large-scale analyses with many files, interactive tools for exploratory data analysis, and a complete suite of machine learning tools. Important scientific developments enabled by Galaxy include Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP) assembly workflows and global SARS-CoV-2 collaborations.}",

    abstract = {There are thousands of well-maintained high-quality open-source software utilities for all aspects of scientific data analysis. For over a decade, the Galaxy Project has been providing computational infrastructure and a unified user interface for these tools to make them accessible to a wide range of researchers. In order to streamline the process of integrating tools and constructing workflows as much as possible, we have developed Planemo, a software development kit for tool and workflow developers and Galaxy power users. Here we outline Planemo{\textquoteright}s implementation and describe its broad range of functionality for designing, testing and executing Galaxy tools, workflows and training material. In addition, we discuss the philosophy underlying Galaxy tool and workflow development, and how Planemo encourages the use of development best practices, such as test-driven development, by its users, including those who are not professional software developers. Planemo is a mature project widely used within the Galaxy community which has been downloaded over 80,000 times.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
