Benchmarks on real Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) datasets demonstrate that cuteSV has better yields and scalability than state-of-the-art tools.	cuteSV	cuteSV	Long Read based Human Genomic Structural Variation Detection with cuteSV | Long-read sequencing technologies enable to comprehensively discover structural variations (SVs).

To enable the use of GO slims, it is accompanied by a sister tool GOSlimmer, which can convert annotation files from full GO to any specified GO slim.The tool features an optional graph clustering algorithm to reduce the redundancy in the set of enriched GO terms and simplify its output.It was developed by the BioData.pt / ELIXIR-PT team at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.
