cutesv	235.0	17.0	cutesv	Long-read sequencing enables the comprehensive discovery of structural variations (SVs). However, it is still non-trivial to achieve high sensitivity and performance simultaneously due to the complex SV characteristics implied by noisy long reads. Therefore, we propose cuteSV, a sensitive, fast and scalable long-read-based SV detection approach. cuteSV uses tailored methods to collect the signatures of various types of SVs and employs a clustering-and-refinement method to analyze the signatures to implement sensitive SV detection. Benchmarks on real Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) datasets demonstrate that cuteSV has better yields and scalability than state-of-the-art tools.	cuteSV	cuteSV		cuteSV	Long Read based Human Genomic Structural Variation Detection with cuteSV | Long-read sequencing technologies enable to comprehensively discover structural variations (SVs).

It is a differential motif discovery algorithm, which means that it takes two sets of sequences and tries to identify the regulatory elements that are specifically enriched in on set relative to the other.  It uses ZOOPS scoring (zero or one occurrence per sequence) coupled with the hypergeometric enrichment calculations (or binomial) to determine motif enrichment.  HOMER also tries its best to account for sequenced bias in the dataset.  It was designed with ChIP-Seq and promoter analysis in mind, but can be applied to pretty much any nucleic acids motif finding problem.

We have used them for Illumia,SOLiD, 454, Ion Torrent, and Pac Bio sequencing data. We have used them for DNA and RNA resequcing,ChIP-Seq, CLIP-Seq, and targeted resequencing (Agilent exome capture and PCR targeting).These tools are also used heavily in our in-house DNA and RNA mapping pipelines.NGSUtils is made up of 50+ programs, mainly written in Python.These are separated into modules based on the type of file that is to be analyzed.	ngsutils	ngsutils		NGSUtils	NGSUtils is a suite of software tools for working with next-generation sequencing datasets	Read pre-processing, Sequencing quality control, Variant calling, Formatting, Sequence contamination filtering	Genomics, Transcriptomics	To update	https://github.com/ngsutils/ngsutils	SAM		iuc	https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/ngsutils	https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/ngsutils		ngsutils	0.5.9	(1/1)	(1/1)	(1/1)	(1/1)

seqkit			seqkit_fx2tab, seqkit_locate, seqkit_sort, seqkit_stats, seqkit_translate	A cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file manipulation	seqkit	seqkit		seqkit	FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing nucleotide and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.
