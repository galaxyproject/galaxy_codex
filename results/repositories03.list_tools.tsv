bowtie2	bowtie2	Bowtie2: Fast and sensitive read alignment	bowtie2	bowtie2		Bowtie 2	Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.

cutesv	cutesv	Long-read sequencing enables the comprehensive discovery of structural variations (SVs). However, it is still non-trivial to achieve high sensitivity and performance simultaneously due to the complex SV characteristics implied by noisy long reads. Therefore, we propose cuteSV, a sensitive, fast and scalable long-read-based SV detection approach. cuteSV uses tailored methods to collect the signatures of various types of SVs and employs a clustering-and-refinement method to analyze the signatures to implement sensitive SV detection. Benchmarks on real Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) datasets demonstrate that cuteSV has better yields and scalability than state-of-the-art tools.	cuteSV	cuteSV		cuteSV	Long Read based Human Genomic Structural Variation Detection with cuteSV | Long-read sequencing technologies enable to comprehensively discover structural variations (SVs).

Herein, we propose cuteSV, a sensitive, fast and lightweight SV detection approach. cuteSV uses tailored methods to comprehensively collect various types of SV signatures, and a clustering-and-refinement method to implement a stepwise SV detection, which enables to achieve high sensitivity without loss of accuracy.

It can either run as a stand alone interactive application for the immediate analysis of small numbers of FastQ files, or it can be run in a non-interactive mode where it would be suitable for integrating into a larger analysis pipeline for the systematic processing of large numbers of files.

It is a differential motif discovery algorithm, which means that it takes two sets of sequences and tries to identify the regulatory elements that are specifically enriched in on set relative to the other.  It uses ZOOPS scoring (zero or one occurrence per sequence) coupled with the hypergeometric enrichment calculations (or binomial) to determine motif enrichment.  HOMER also tries its best to account for sequenced bias in the dataset.  It was designed with ChIP-Seq and promoter analysis in mind, but can be applied to pretty much any nucleic acids motif finding problem.

MEGAN is a tool for studying the taxonomic content of a set of DNA reads, typically collected in a metagenomics project.In a preprocessing step, a sequence alignment of all reads against a suitable database of reference DNA or proteinsequences must be performed to produce an input file for the program. MEGAN is suitable for DNA reads (metagenomedata), RNA reads (metatranscriptome data), peptide sequences (metaproteomics data) and, using a suitable synonymsfile that maps SILVA ids to taxon ids, for 16S rRNA data (amplicon sequencing).	megan	megan		MEGAN	Metagenome Analysis Software - MEGAN (MEtaGenome ANalyzer) is a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic datasets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA reads (or contigs) is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN can then be used to compute and interactively explore the taxonomical content of the dataset, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results.

ngsutils	ngsutils_bam_filter	NGSUtils is a suite of software tools for working with next-generation sequencing datasets.Starting in 2009, we (Liu Lab @ Indiana University School of Medicine) starting working withnext-generation sequencing data. We initially started doing custom coding for each project in a one-off manner.It quickly became apparent that this was an inefficient manner to work, so we started assembling smallerutilities that could be adapted into larger, more complicated, workflows. We have used them for Illumia,SOLiD, 454, Ion Torrent, and Pac Bio sequencing data. We have used them for DNA and RNA resequcing,ChIP-Seq, CLIP-Seq, and targeted resequencing (Agilent exome capture and PCR targeting).These tools are also used heavily in our in-house DNA and RNA mapping pipelines.NGSUtils is made up of 50+ programs, mainly written in Python.These are separated into modules based on the type of file that is to be analyzed.	ngsutils	ngsutils		NGSUtils	NGSUtils is a suite of software tools for working with next-generation sequencing datasets	Read pre-processing, Sequencing quality control, Variant calling, Formatting, Sequence contamination filtering	Genomics, Transcriptomics	To update	https://github.com/ngsutils/ngsutils	SAM		iuc	https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/ngsutils	https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/ngsutils		ngsutils	0.5.9	Read pre-processing, Variant calling, Formatting, Sequence contamination filtering	Transcriptomics	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	224	24740

seqkit	seqkit_fx2tab, seqkit_locate, seqkit_sort, seqkit_stats, seqkit_translate	A cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file manipulation	seqkit	seqkit		seqkit	FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing nucleotide and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.

taxpasta	taxpasta	standardise taxonomic profiles	taxpasta	taxpasta		taxpasta	TAXonomic Profile Aggregation and STAndardisationThe main purpose of taxpasta is to standardise taxonomic profiles created by a range of bioinformatics tools. We call those tools taxonomic profilers. They each come with their own particular tabular output format. Across the profilers, relative abundances can be reported in read counts, fractions, or percentages, as well as any number of additional columns with extra information. We therefore decided to take the lessons learnt to heart and provide our own solution to deal with this pasticcio. With taxpasta you can ingest all of those formats and, at a minimum, output taxonomy identifiers and their integer counts. Taxpasta can not only standardise profiles but also merge them across samples for the same profiler into a single table.
