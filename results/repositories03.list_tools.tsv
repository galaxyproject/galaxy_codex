cutesv	cutesv	Long-read sequencing enables the comprehensive discovery of structural variations (SVs). However, it is still non-trivial to achieve high sensitivity and performance simultaneously due to the complex SV characteristics implied by noisy long reads. Therefore, we propose cuteSV, a sensitive, fast and scalable long-read-based SV detection approach. cuteSV uses tailored methods to collect the signatures of various types of SVs and employs a clustering-and-refinement method to analyze the signatures to implement sensitive SV detection. Benchmarks on real Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) datasets demonstrate that cuteSV has better yields and scalability than state-of-the-art tools.	cuteSV	cuteSV	Long Read based Human Genomic Structural Variation Detection with cuteSV | Long-read sequencing technologies enable to comprehensively discover structural variations (SVs).

It is available in Galaxy Europe and as a stand-alone tool.GOEnrichment is flexible in that it allows the user to use any version of the Gene Ontology and any GO annotation file they desire. To enable the use of GO slims, it is accompanied by a sister tool GOSlimmer, which can convert annotation files from full GO to any specified GO slim.The tool features an optional graph clustering algorithm to reduce the redundancy in the set of enriched GO terms and simplify its output.It was developed by the BioData.pt / ELIXIR-PT team at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.

It is a differential motif discovery algorithm, which means that it takes two sets of sequences and tries to identify the regulatory elements that are specifically enriched in on set relative to the other.  It uses ZOOPS scoring (zero or one occurrence per sequence) coupled with the hypergeometric enrichment calculations (or binomial) to determine motif enrichment.  HOMER also tries its best to account for sequenced bias in the dataset.  It was designed with ChIP-Seq and promoter analysis in mind, but can be applied to pretty much any nucleic acids motif finding problem.

We have used them for Illumia,SOLiD, 454, Ion Torrent, and Pac Bio sequencing data. We have used them for DNA and RNA resequcing,ChIP-Seq, CLIP-Seq, and targeted resequencing (Agilent exome capture and PCR targeting).These tools are also used heavily in our in-house DNA and RNA mapping pipelines.NGSUtils is made up of 50+ programs, mainly written in Python.These are separated into modules based on the type of file that is to be analyzed.	ngsutils	NGSUtils	NGSUtils is a suite of software tools for working with next-generation sequencing datasets	Read pre-processing, Sequencing quality control, Variant calling, Formatting, Sequence contamination filtering	Genomics, Transcriptomics	To update	https://github.com/ngsutils/ngsutils	SAM		iuc	https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/ngsutils		ngsutils	0.5.9

Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.

kraken	kraken-filter, kraken-mpa-report, kraken-report, kraken-translate, kraken	Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNAsequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by otherbioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignmentor machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to the developmentof less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation programs. Kraken aims toachieve high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mersand a novel classification algorithm.
