aldex2	129.0	13.0	aldex2	Performs analysis Of differential abundance taking sample variation into account	aldex2		ALDEx2	A differential abundance analysis for the comparison of two or more conditions. It uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts, that has been optimized for three or more experimental replicates. Infers sampling variation and calculates the expected FDR given the biological and sampling variation using the Wilcox rank test and Welches t-test, or the glm and Kruskal Wallis tests. Reports both P and fdr values calculated by the Benjamini Hochberg correction.
