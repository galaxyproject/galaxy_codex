cutesv	17	cutesv	Long-read sequencing enables the comprehensive discovery of structural variations (SVs). However, it is still non-trivial to achieve high sensitivity and performance simultaneously due to the complex SV characteristics implied by noisy long reads. Therefore, we propose cuteSV, a sensitive, fast and scalable long-read-based SV detection approach. cuteSV uses tailored methods to collect the signatures of various types of SVs and employs a clustering-and-refinement method to analyze the signatures to implement sensitive SV detection. Benchmarks on real Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) datasets demonstrate that cuteSV has better yields and scalability than state-of-the-art tools.	cuteSV	cuteSV	Long Read based Human Genomic Structural Variation Detection with cuteSV | Long-read sequencing technologies enable to comprehensively discover structural variations (SVs). However, it is still non-trivial for state-of-the-art approaches to detect SVs with high sensitivity or high performance or both. Herein, we propose cuteSV, a sensitive, fast and lightweight SV detection approach. cuteSV uses tailored methods to comprehensively collect various types of SV signatures, and a clustering-and-refinement method to implement a stepwise SV detection, which enables to achieve high sensitivity without loss of accuracy. Benchmark results demonstrate that cuteSV has better yields on real datasets.

It is available in Galaxy Europe and as a stand-alone tool.GOEnrichment is flexible in that it allows the user to use any version of the Gene Ontology and any GO annotation file they desire. To enable the use of GO slims, it is accompanied by a sister tool GOSlimmer, which can convert annotation files from full GO to any specified GO slim.The tool features an optional graph clustering algorithm to reduce the redundancy in the set of enriched GO terms and simplify its output.It was developed by the BioData.pt / ELIXIR-PT team at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.
