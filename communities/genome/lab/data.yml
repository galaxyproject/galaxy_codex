        description_md: >
          <p>
            You can upload your data to Galaxy using the Upload tool from anywhere in Galaxy. Just look for the "Upload data" button at the top of the tool panel.
          </p>

      - title_md: How can I subsample my data?
        description_md: >
          <p>
            We recommend subsampling large data sets to test tools and workflows. A useful tool is <code>seqtk_seq</code>, setting the parameter at "Sample fraction of sequences".
          </p>
      - title_md: How can I import data from the BPA portal?
        description_md: >
          <p>
            BioPlatforms Australia allows data downloads via URL. Once you have generated one of these URLs in the BPA portal, you can import it into Galaxy using the "Fetch data" feature of the Upload tool.
