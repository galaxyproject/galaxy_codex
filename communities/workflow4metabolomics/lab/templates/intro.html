    Welcome to the collaborative portal dedicated to metabolomics data processing, analysis and annotation for the Metabolomics community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Metabolomics is a -omic science known for being one of the most closely related to phenotypes. It involves the study of different types of matrices, such as blood, urine, tissues, in various organisms including plants. It focuses on studying the very small molecules which are called metabolites, to better understand matters linked to the metabolism.

    In a collaborative efforts between metabolomics (MetaboHub French infrastructure) and bioinformatics platforms (IFB - Institut Français de Bioinformatique), we’ve crafted comprehensive LC/MS, GC/MS, and NMR pipelines using the robust framework. Our pipelines cover the entire spectrum of data analysis, encompassing preprocessing, normalization, quality control, statistical analysis, and annotation steps.
