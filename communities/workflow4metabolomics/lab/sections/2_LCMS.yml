        This workflow is composed with the XCMS tool R package (Smith, C.A. 2006) able to extract, filter, align and fill gapand the possibility to annotate isotopes, adducts and fragments using the CAMERA R package (Kuhl, C 2012).

      After the pre-processing step, what you have at your disposal is a list of ions (hereafter in the form of a “variableMetadata” file) and the corresponding intensities (“dataMatrix” file).
      What you may want now is to get some relevant information from your tables. However, your data may not be suitable yet for statistical analysis.
      What should you do to ensure the quality of your tables? This tutorial will show you what the usual quality steps are.
