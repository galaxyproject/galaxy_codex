    Welcome to the Galaxy {{ site_name }} {{ lab_name }} by the {{ lab_name }} community!
  </p>

  <p>
    Biodiversity is an incredibly vast field, spanning genetic diversity, species interactions, and ecosystem dynamics. While this lab currently focuses on genomics-based biodiversity research, we recognize the importance of exploring all dimensions of biodiversity.
  <p>
In this lab, you will find a curated collection of tools, workflows, and tutorials tailored to biodiversity genomic research. These resources were initially extracted from multiple sources—including the ToolShed, WorkflowHub, and the Galaxy Training Website—based on relevant categories or tags. The extracted list was then manually refined to exclude irrelevant or deprecated content, ensuring only high-quality resources were included.
  <p>
This lab is largely based on tools, workflows and tutorials produced by the Galaxy Ecology community and propose a focus on biodiversity genomics. Communities are groups that centralize, review, and curate code for Galaxy tools, acting as collective "owners" to ensure quality and consistency before tools are published in the Toolshed. This would not be possible without them : 
    - <a href="https://ecology.usegalaxy.eu/">Ecology</a>
    - <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/genome-annotation/">Genome annotation</a>
    - <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/earth/">Earth</a>
    - <a href="https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/">Climate</a>

The complete list of communities is available <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig">here</a>
  <p>

We are eager to expand our focus and integrate additional aspects of biodiversity. If you would like to contribute to this lab or be listed above, please get in touch with us—we would be happy to collaborate.
