    description_md: OBIS is a global open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation and sustainable development. In order to visualize their marine data OBIS created the R package obisindicators. The purpose was to create an ES50 diversity index within hexagonal grids following the diversity indicators notebook by Pieter Provoost. This tutorial will guide you on getting obis marine data and processing them in order to calculate and visualize multiple indicators.
