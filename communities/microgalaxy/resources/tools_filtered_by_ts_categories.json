The new features include (i) building gene-based and supermatrix-based phylogenies using a single command, (ii) testing and visualizing evolutionary models, (iii) calculating distances between trees of different size or including duplications, and (iv) providing seamless integration with the NCBI taxonomy database.

This means instaGRAAL (or indeed any CUDA-based application) will not work on Mojave. If you wish to run it on OS X, the only solution for now is to downgrade to High Sierra (10.13)",

It uses ZOOPS scoring (zero or one occurrence per sequence) coupled with the hypergeometric enrichment calculations (or binomial) to determine motif enrichment.  HOMER also tries its best to account for sequenced bias in the dataset.  It was designed with ChIP-Seq and promoter analysis in mind, but can be applied to pretty much any nucleic acids motif finding problem.",

Kc-Align is a codon-aware multiple aligner that uses Kalgin2 to produce in-frame gapped codon alignments for selection analysis of small genomes (mostly viral and some smaller bacterial genomes). Takes nucleotide seqeunces as inputs, converts them to their in-frame amino acid sequences, performs multiple alignment with Kalign, and then converts the alignments back to their original codon sequence while preserving the gaps. Produces three outputs: the gapped nucleotide alignments in FASTA format and in CLUSTAL format and the amino acid level alignment.Kc-Align will also attempt to detect any frameshift mutations in the input reads. If a frameshift is detected, that sequence will not be included in the multiple alignment and its ID will be printed to stdout.",

MEGAN is a tool for studying the taxonomic content of a set of DNA reads, typically collected in a metagenomics project.In a preprocessing step, a sequence alignment of all reads against a suitable database of reference DNA or proteinsequences must be performed to produce an input file for the program. MEGAN is suitable for DNA reads (metagenomedata), RNA reads (metatranscriptome data), peptide sequences (metaproteomics data) and, using a suitable synonymsfile that maps SILVA ids to taxon ids, for 16S rRNA data (amplicon sequencing).",

Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.",

We call those tools taxonomic profilers. They each come with their own particular tabular output format. Across the profilers, relative abundances can be reported in read counts, fractions, or percentages, as well as any number of additional columns with extra information. We therefore decided to take the lessons learnt to heart and provide our own solution to deal with this pasticcio. With taxpasta you can ingest all of those formats and, at a minimum, output taxonomy identifiers and their integer counts. Taxpasta can not only standardise profiles but also merge them across samples for the same profiler into a single table.",
