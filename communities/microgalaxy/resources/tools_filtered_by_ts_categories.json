Here, we present ETE v3, featuring numerous improvements in the underlying library of methods, and providing a novel set of standalone tools to perform common tasks in comparative genomics and phylogenetics. The new features include (i) building gene-based and supermatrix-based phylogenies using a single command, (ii) testing and visualizing evolutionary models, (iii) calculating distances between trees of different size or including duplications, and (iv) providing seamless integration with the NCBI taxonomy database.

Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.",

        "bio.tool description": "TAXonomic Profile Aggregation and STAndardisationThe main purpose of taxpasta is to standardise taxonomic profiles created by a range of bioinformatics tools. We call those tools taxonomic profilers. They each come with their own particular tabular output format. Across the profilers, relative abundances can be reported in read counts, fractions, or percentages, as well as any number of additional columns with extra information. We therefore decided to take the lessons learnt to heart and provide our own solution to deal with this pasticcio. With taxpasta you can ingest all of those formats and, at a minimum, output taxonomy identifiers and their integer counts. Taxpasta can not only standardise profiles but also merge them across samples for the same profiler into a single table.",

Previous attempts by otherbioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignmentor machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to the developmentof less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation programs. Kraken aims toachieve high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mersand a novel classification algorithm.",
